# boids-algorithm
Implementation of Boids algorithm using the Unity Game Engine. Boids algorithm, introduced by Craig Renolds in 1987, has become a foundational method for simulating collective behaviour in computer graphics and swarm intelligence research. Inspired by the swarming of birds it implements three basic rules to achieve a complicated flight pattern.
